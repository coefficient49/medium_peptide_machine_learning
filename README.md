# medium_peptide_machine_learning

Work in progress

Project set up:

util_tools.py for getting data from repo and class constructor for encoding peptide data for models. Work in progress

model_setup_tools.py to functionalize the model generation, train/test/plot Work in progress

run_simple_model.py create models and train model using different hyperparameters. Work in progress

jupyter notebooks for quick prototyping. Will clean up and use to draft blog post.
